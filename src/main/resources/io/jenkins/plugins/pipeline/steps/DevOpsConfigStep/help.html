    This action streamlines and enhances the functionality of DevOps Config by integrating multiple operations into a single action. <br/>
	The revamped process follows these steps:<br/>
	<b>Upload</b>: The action begins by uploading files specified in a regex format.<br/>
	<b>Validation and Publishing</b>: Config data validation and publishing can be customized through arguments provided for this action.<br/>
	<b>Snapshot Retrieval</b>: After the upload, the action retrieves the created snapshots and waits for the validation process to complete. It generates test results based on user input.<br/>
	<b>Changeset Registration</b>: The action registers the changeset with the pipeline execution.<br/>
	Finally, the action returns a list of snapshot objects.
